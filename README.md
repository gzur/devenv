# Environment isolator (working title)
Environment isolator (working title) - Initial commit

Working protoype of a general-purpose dockerized shell environment manager (virtualenv gone nuclear)
Features:
* Isolate development environments - no more runtime clashes.
* Persist mind-palaces - come back to a project months later and find it where you left it (in terms of bash history and installed dependencies)
